## Info - Kubernetes
<pre>
- it is one of the Container Orchestration Platforms
- it is developed in Golang by Google
- it is opensource and free for personal & commercial use
- any containerized application workloads can be deployed into Kubernetes a.k.a k8s
- it generally as group(cluster) of machines/nodes
- there are 2 types of nodes
  - Master node ( Control Plane components will be running here )
  - Worker node ( user application workloads will be running here )
- Kubernetes Control Plane
  1. API Server
  2. etcd database
  3. Scheduler
  4. Controller Managers ( a group of many Controllers )
- it supports only Command-line interface
- supports extending its Kubernetes API(features) by adding
  - Custom Resources by defining Custom Resource Definitions a.k.a CRD
  - Custom Controller to manage your Custom Resources
  - it is generally installed as Kubernetes Operators
  - Kubernetes Operators
    - a packaged CRs(CRDs) with many custom controllers to manage the CRs
- we can only deploy application for which there is a Container Image
- it is your responsibility to build a custom container image with your custom application + all its dependencies
- the client tool used is kubectl
- with the help kubectl we can interact with Kubernetes cluster
- kubeadm
  - is the administration client tool
  
</pre>  

## Info - Openshift
<pre>
- it is a Container Orchestration Platform
- it is developed by Red Hat on top of opensource Kubernetes
- Red Hat has added many additional features on top of Kubernetes
  - Web Console
  - User Management 
  - Internal Container Registry
  - Many new features
    - S2I - Source to Image i.e one can deploy application from source code coming from Version Control
  - Route
  - Build, BuildConfig, DeploymentConfig
- Openshift is a superset of Kubernetes
- Official definition - OpenShift is Red Hat's Kubernetes Distribution
- all the features that works in k8s will also work in Openshift
- OpenShift support many additional features on top of what is already supported by Kubernetes
- Openshift added additional features on top of K8s using the K8s Operators 
- Openshift Operators
  - one or more Custom Resources defined as CRDs
  - one or more Custom Controllers that manages the custom resources (CRs)
- kubectl and oc i.e client tools can be used be in Openshift to manage your application deployments
- oc Openshift client tool combines kubectl and kubeadm with many additional features 
</pre>  

## Info - Rancher Overview
<pre>
- it orchestrates/manages Kubernetes Cluster
